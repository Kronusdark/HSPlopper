Plopper is a view controller that displays in a neat animated popup, and is dismissed when tapped. 

You can add text or other elements to the plopper by using `addSubview` before displaying it on the screen.

Plopper API will eventually be compatible with UIAlertView so it can be a drop-in replacement.

Look at the included Demo for instructions on use. (I promise it is very simple.)
